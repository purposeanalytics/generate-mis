  # Individuals are counted each time a new file is created upon their admission to the agency. Service Recipient category is required. The decision date of eligibility is the admit date.
  # - May be counted more than once per year if a file has been closed and opened in the same year.
  # -	Reporting is valid with age category – unknown, S501** 90
  # -	Will always be equal to or greater than the S855* account value
  # Every Admission must have a File Closed (S511*) recorded when services end.  These are reported in the accounting centre 8 2 9 90.

  # S512 ** ** Assessment Complete/Outcome (4th, 5th digits = SR category)
  # -	Number of assessments that have been completed, along with the outcome of that assessment.  The count of assessment occurs once the eligibility of the client has been determined.  Where applicable, the assessment will be used to develop the care plan for the client.
  # -	Cumulative year-to-date count of the number of assessments, i.e. both the completed initial and update assessments of the same SR can be included in the report period.  Basic demographic information is not an assessment for clients.
  # -	Mandatory reporting for the CSS sector.
  # -	This may include RAI-CHA, RAI-PS and other formal assessments (initial or update) which are used to develop care plan.
  # -	Only one S512* is reported for an assessment completed for a SR receiving multiple services in either the case management or a service delivery FC. When an assessment is completed and the client is deemed eligible but declines to receive service, report S512**11 (eligible in-home services – client declined).
  #
  # Report S512* in the Case Management FC
  # -	When a centralized or formal admission/intake process is used
  # -	Relevant S512* can be reported for a SR assessed as requiring only a specific service (e.g. S5128022 Assessment Complete/Outcome - Supportive Housing for SRs that will receive assisted living services)
  # -	S512**12 (eligible in-home services – admitted) is used when a client is assessed as requiring multi service
  #
  # Report in a 725* service delivery FC
  # -		The account can be reported in the FC where the assessment is completed
  # -		S512**12  (eligible in-home services – admitted) is usually reported for a completed assessment for a client who is eligible for one or more service(s).
  # The completion of a client assessment cannot be reported as CSS SR activity (e.g. visit) in a 725* service delivery FC except for the Case Management FC; where the client assessment is part of the mandate of the case management FC.  A client activity statistic is only reported when service is provided to or received by a SR and is within the scope of the individual FC’s service mandate/definition.
